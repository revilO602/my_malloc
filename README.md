# Memory managment

This project is a custom implementation of `malloc()` and `free()` functions in C using an explicit linked list of free blocks. We use a best fit algorithm to minimize fragmentation.

Full documentation including acceptance tests, space efficiency tests, time efficiency tests, full analysis including big O notation calculations and comparisons for the custom alloc and free operations is in  _dokumentacia.pdf_ in Slovak.

This is the first project from my Data Structures and Algorithms university course.
